					In India, the patient-doctor relationship faces a significant
					challenge. Patients are burdened with the task of maintaining and
					presenting their extensive paper-based medical records. The loss or
					misplacement of these records often leads to a fragmented
					understanding of a patient&apos;s medical history. This not only puts
					a strain on doctors but also compromises the quality of care,
					resulting in potential health risks. Introducing MediBank,{" "}
					<span className="text-[#6D4AFF]">
						India&apos;s first cloud based Electronic Health Records (EHR)
						platform with centralised digital health records accessible by both
						patients and doctors.
					</span>{" "}
					MediBank offers a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly Electronic
					Health Record (EHR) platform which eliminates the hassle of paper
					prescriptions and the risk of lost information. By centralizing &
					digitising health records and utilising the inbuilt AI-driven health
					charts, we aim to streamline healthcare coordination and enable early
					detection of potential health issues, thereby advancing preventive
					care in India.
