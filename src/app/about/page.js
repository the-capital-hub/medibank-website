						India has witnessed remarkable digital advancements across various
						sectors, yet health records remain largely confined to pen, paper &
						folders, making them difficult to maintain and track. <br />
						<br />
						To bridge this gap and align with the nation&apos;s digitisation
						trend, Medibank was created as India&apos;s first patient-centric
						Electronic Health Record platform. By digitising healthcare records
						and utilising AI to generate health analysis charts of those
						records, Medibank aims to simplify access, streamline communication,
						and improve the overall experience for both patients and doctors,
						ensuring a more efficient and modern approach to healthcare
						management. <br />
						<br />
						We are working towards a healthcare system in India, where citizens
						have the option to visit any healthcare provider or institution in
						any part of the country without the need of carrying physical
						medical records. <br />
