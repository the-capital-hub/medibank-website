						integral role in connecting all of them to provide real-time data of
						patients at a common platform.
					</p>
					<p className="text-lg mb-4">
						Electronic Health Records (EHR) is the digitized collection of
						patients&apos; or populations&apos; medical or health information.
						The vital health records of people are entered electronically by the
						healthcare providers throughout his/her lifetime. EHRs aim towards
						making patient-centered records securely and instantly available to
						authorized users on demand. EHRs form an immensely vital part of
						health IT as it encompasses all advanced treatment histories of
						patients:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-6">
						<li>
							Contains patient&apos;s medical diagnoses, history, radiology

					<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">EHR for India</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						The Government of India aims to introduce a uniform maintenance
						system of Electronic Medical Records / Electronic Health Records
						(EMR / EHR) by the healthcare providers and hospitals across the
						nation. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare first initiated the
						standards for Electronic Health Record (EHR) for India back in
						September 2013. These pointers were on the basis of the
						recommendations made by the EMR Standards Committee constituted
						under the MoH&FW.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						The draft of the EHR/ EMR Standards was hosted on the website of the
						Ministry initially, soliciting comments from the general public and
						stakeholders before implementation. After considering all the
						recommendations, the ‘EHR’ was finally passed by the Ministry of
						Health and Family Welfare.

						Steps to a Successful Implementation of EHR
					</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Implementing an electronic health record is not an easy process, as
						it can get very challenging if not carefully undertaken using a
						step-by-step approach. This step-by-step approach is guided by six
						significant steps:
					</p>
					<ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 pl-6">
						<li>
							<strong>Assess the Organization&apos;s Readiness:</strong> The
							preliminary step towards EHR implementation is to assess the
							organization&apos;s current needs, goals, along with its financial
							and technical readiness towards the change. Only after having an
							accurate view of the preparedness can organizations design an EHR
							implementation plan that matches the specific organizational
							needs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Plan the Adoption Approach:</strong> In the planning
							phase, organizations need to draw on the information gathered
							during the assessment stage to outline their EHR implementation
							plan. It is essential to measure and view each minute aspect of
							the plan from an electronic point-of-view.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Upgrade to or Select a Certified EHR:</strong>{" "}
							Organizations should upgrade to or select a certified and trusted
							EHR. The EHR implementation team should leverage the information
							gathered in the planning and assessment phases to choose the
							perfect EHR matching the organization’s needs and challenges.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>
								Conduct Training for Effective Implementation of an EHR System:
							</strong>{" "}
							During this phase, organizations need to focus on training to
							ensure successful migration to electronic data maintenance. They
							will also need to prepare for EHR implementation go-live,
							including training, pre-go-live dress rehearsals, and elaborate
							pilot testing.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Achieve Meaningful Use:</strong> Organizations should work
							towards achieving meaningful use, focusing on the shift towards
							the Merit-based Incentive Payment System. The introduction of
							MACRA (the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act) brought
							in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, which transitioned into the
							Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), harmonizing existing
							CMS quality programs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Continue Quality Improvement:</strong> Once enterprises
							have implemented an EHR and achieved its desired meaningful use,
							they should focus on continuous evaluation and improvement. It is
							critical to revisit the organization’s goals and needs to refine
							workflows and improve patient outcomes continuously.
						</li>

						Security Challenges in EHRs
					</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Compared to paper medical records, threats to electronic health
						records security will be a hurdle to the efficient sharing of
						medical records within organizations. But, to optimize its benefits,
						organizations need to consider and overcome major issues in
						electronic health records:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-6">
						<li>
							<strong>Data Interoperability:</strong> The use of EHRs has
							multiple benefits to healthcare organizations, but these
							advantages are linked to data interoperability. When medical
							records are retrieved or saved, various aspects of the records are
							involved. The lack of interoperability solutions and standards has
							been a significant obstacle in the exchange of healthcare data
							between multiple stakeholders.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Security:</strong> Organizations need to balance
							information risks and controls. EHR systems may have multiple
							security vulnerabilities, and one of the biggest threats is
							malicious code. Ensuring software and hardware vulnerabilities are
							addressed is crucial to protect the system and maintain business
							continuity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Business Continuity:</strong> Business continuity planning
							(BCP) is essential for maintaining continuous operations before,
							during, and after disaster events. Network failures, hardware
							failures, data loss, and attacks are examples of disruptions that
							EHR systems must handle with effective BCP in place.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Digital Divide:</strong> The digital divide defines the
							gap between those with access to and know-how of technologies and
							those without. This issue leaves many patients behind, especially
							in developing countries, where EHRs are often not available. Lack
							of skill, infrastructure, and knowledge exacerbates this problem.

						Challenges Faced by India for Implementation of EHR
					</h2>
					<p className="mb-4">
						The development and implementation of EHRs involve numerous
						challenges, especially in the Indian healthcare industry. Key
						challenges include:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-6">
						<li>
							<strong>Cost:</strong> EHR implementation is expensive, covering
							hardware, software, implementation assistance, staff training,
							ongoing network fees, and maintenance. Smaller establishments may
							struggle to find financial resources for EHR implementation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Data privacy concerns are
							significant due to the risk of data leakage from cyber attacks or
							natural disasters. Security breaches can lead to legal and
							financial repercussions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Data Migration:</strong> Migrating from paper-based to
							digital records is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially
							without a defined format of data management.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Training:</strong> Proper training is required for staff
							to adapt to the new system. The time and effort required for
							training can cause business disruptions, particularly for small
							and mid-sized organizations.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Time:</strong> The process of digitization is lengthy,
							involving both training and data input, which can be challenging.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Many small healthcare providers
							lack the technical support and hardware needed for EHR systems,
							which delays implementation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Incomplete Coverage of Aadhar:</strong> The lack of
							complete Aadhar coverage has created gaps in the implementation of
							EHRs, exacerbating data security issues.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Suitable Vendors:</strong> Finding reliable vendors for
							EHR setup, migration, and training remains a challenge for many
							organizations.
						</li>
					</ul>
